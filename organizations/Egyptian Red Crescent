Our Vision
Egyptian Red Crescent works to achieve the ultimate goal of alleviating humanitarian sufferings especially for those in crisis.

Our Mission
Believing in the power of humanity and strength of our volunteer network, Egyptian Red Crescent works as an auxiliary body to the government
and as a part of the international Red Cross/ Red Crescent movement to provide effective and timely response in crisis and
help people to survive and recover. We work with vulnerable communities to strengthen their own capacities to respond to disasters and
recover afterwards.

Our Fields Of Work
ERC works in various fields that all lead to reducing humanitarian sufferings and improving lives of less-advantaged communities:

Disaster Management:  preparedness, response and recovery are the three main domains that collectively form the disaster
management cycle. Guided by its disaster management strategy and plan of action, ERC responds to all national disasters as well many
regional and international ones.
Health services and health promotion:  various activities including blood banks and blood donation, primary health care services,
vaccination campaigns and hygiene and health promotion are conducted by ERC all over the country.
Social services:  rural, urban and suburban development is an important area of action that ERC gives special attention. Slums
development is among our main concerns.
